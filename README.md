Submitted by: **Jimmy Chen**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
